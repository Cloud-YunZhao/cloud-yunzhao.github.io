I am currently a PhD candidate at West Virginia University, working with [Prof. Brijes Mishra](https://faculty.utah.edu/u6040186-BRIJES_MISHRA/hm/index.hml) to investigate the size effect on the strength of shale under compressive stress conditions. This work will help improve the understanding of roof failure in underground coal mines. I have been studying and researching in mining engineering for 10 years. My education starts from open-pit metal mines to underground coal mines. The research includes slope, ore pass, and mine roof.

Education
======
* B.S. in Minining Enginerring, Wuhan University of Technology, 2016
* M.S. in Minining Enginerring, Wuhan University of Technology, 2019
* Ph.D in Minining Enginerring, West Virginia University, August 2022 (expected)

Work experience
======
* **Stability analysis of the slope in an open-pit mine**   
  I developed a numerical model that enable the dynamic analysis of slope failure. The outcome is part of my bachelor’s thesis, which was awarded the “Excellent bachelor's thesis of Hubei Province”.

* **Damage analysis of the ore pass wall and its protection**   
  I simulated the ore flow movement, determined the key position of failure, and proposed the protection strategy. My effort enables mining engineers easily to determine the failure position and damage severity on ore pass in practice. The research produced three peer-review journal papers
  
* **Anasotropy and size effect of shale strength**  
  I proposed an anisotropic and size-dependent failure criterion for describing the shale strength, collected previous publications on the size effect of rock strength for verifying the failure criterion, and developed a bonded-particle model for modeling the anisotropy and size effect of shale. I am conducting the uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial compression test of shale at different sizes and different orientations.
